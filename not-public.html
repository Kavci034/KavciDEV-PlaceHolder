        <h2>The Code is Not Public Yet</h2>
        <p>I didn't make the code public yet. I will wait until the site has reached some nice state before I make the code public.
            Some of the reasons for this include: I didn't write any code yet and I dont want you see bad code.
            I will make you Notified on the main page about the stage of the actual site.
